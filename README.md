Hey, Iâ€™m Tom (he/him). I'm interested in software / AI and its integration with real-life activities. I'm the rare type of software engineer who spends time outside - bridging the gap between the real and virtual worlds is what interests me the most.

I'm currently learning: C#, including [MAUI](https://github.com/TomsDex/MorseCrypter) and Blazor, and Java?

I'm intending to learn (in rough order): Rust, Python, C++.
