Hey, Iâ€™m Tom (he/him). I'm interested in software / AI and its integration with real-life activities. I'm the rare type of software engineer who spends time outside - bridging the gap between the real and virtual worlds is what interests me the most.

Main contributions: Webmaster at [UBOC](https://github.com/UBOC). I maintain the [UBOC Website](https://uboc.org.uk).

I'm currently learning: C#, including [MAUI](https://github.com/TomsDex/MorseCrypter) (WIP) and Blazor.

I'm intending to learn (in rough order): Rust, Python, C++.
